# Profilestr
Web-app that let's you see all notes from specific `npub`.

üåê [tohrxyz.github.io/profilestr](https://tohrxyz.github.io/profilestr)

..or you can also directly include your `npub` in the url as a hash, this way the server doesn't see it.

### Motivation and tech-stack
I wanted to try to create a functioning nostr-app using nothing but plain javascript without a build process [no-build].

### Dependencies
- Nostr-tools package, pre-built and minified from CDN

### Status
Very much work-in-progress üöß, but this documents my journey through developing on nostr protocol.
